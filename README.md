Time management application. Assignments are shown in order of priority. Assignments with the nearest due date with the least amount of time logged are given the highest priority. 

Use the filter to see the assignment ranking order for tasks in specific courses, or all courses.

## Alternate Use-Case

Base use case has been to manage multiple assignments in multiple courses in university/college. The app can be used outside of this context by defining "assignments" as "tasks" and "courses" as "task categories."

## Instructions

1. Create database files: (a) create "db" directory in project root (b) create "assignments.json" inside db directory (c) create "courses.json" inside db directory

2. Install dependencies: run "npm install" in terminal from the project root directory

3. Run instructions: run "npm start" in terminal from the project root directory
