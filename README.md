Time management application. Assignments are shown in order of priority. Assignments with the nearest due date with the least amount of time logged are given the highest priority. 

Base use case has been to manage multiple assignments in multiple courses in university/college. The app can be used outside of this context by defining "assignments" as "tasks" and "courses" as "task categories."

Use the filter to see the assignment ranking order for tasks in specific courses, or all courses.
